      <p>Hello, I'm Di!</p>
      <p>I'm a <b>Bioinformatics Master's</b> graduate (Class of 2024) and <b>Optional Practical Training student</b> (2024-2025) from the <b>University of Michigan</b>. Before that, I completed my undergraduate studies at University of Pittsburgh (2018-2022), majoring in Computational Biology. Using computational methods to solve questions in the intersecting fields of biology and chemistry is very fascinating me.</p>
      <p>I'm using this GitHub Page as a personal portfolio, currently under construction. Pardon the dust!</p>
